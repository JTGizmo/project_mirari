# Project Mirari
> The word mirror derives from the French “mirour,” from the Latin “mirari” — to admire.
###### Little smart mirror project that I am developing in my spare time.

The goal of this project is to learn Python whilst hopefully also assembling a fully functional smart mirror that is integrated with some of my in house gadgets/features, this file will be updated periodically as I will be progressing with my project. I will be using Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB as the main device to power/enable all the features hopefully.

## Features
Full list of desired features, however it is yet to be determined whether all this is possible. Nevertheless - this would be the perfect set so to speak. I might update it as I progress with my learning.

1. Time and Date display
2. Camera feed - this would be camera feed from the outdoor, to display either full length or partial.
    * Activates on outdoor bell press
    * Functional both during day and night time
    * High Resolution
3. Welcome message
    * Tailored to the user, using facial recognition
4. Motion detection - to activate some of the mirror features when person approaches it.
    * LED light bar
    * Welcome message
5. Facial recognition
    * Tailored welcome message
    * Tailored features on the mirror
6. Weather information
    * Have a set default location but allow also user to change to view weather in other locations
7. Voice recognition
    * Basic voice command recognitions


## TO DO
At this point this seems like an endless list, but you got to start somewhere. This will be heavily edited and changed as this progresses.

1. Investigate whether features are possible
    * Time and Date display - Status: Unknown
    * Camera feed - Status: Unknown
    * Welcome Message - Status: Unknown
    * Motion Detection - Status: Unknown
    * Facial Recognition - Status: Unknown
    * Weather information - Status: Possible
    * Voice recognition - Status: Unknown
    
 2. Outstanding tasks
    * Hide private API key using .env file: Completed
## COMPLETED

v1.0 weather module

## Ideas
Will populate these as I progress
